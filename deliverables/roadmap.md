# Roadmap

In this document, I will describe some of the possible enhancements that can be implemented to the project.

## Strategic enhancement 1: Smart reply suggestions

> Text based interfaces often suffer from discoverability issues. Having suggestions for the replies as a discrete sets of options (to pre-populate the prompt) is possibly a way to solutionize this.

## Strategic enhancement 2: Conversation insights

> Sometimes, the context the agent has is not clear. Also, we must build a clear context for the user. What appointments has the agent made so far? What are the main points of the conversation? We can provide high value insights to the user so that the conversation makes more sense.
