# App Technical Test - Fernando Ortiz deliverables

This is the entry point for my deliverables for this test. Please find links to the important documents in this folder below:

1. [`getting-started.md`](./getting-started.md) includes easy to follow instructions for installing dependencies, running the project and debugging it using [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron).
2. [`current-solution.md`](./current-solution.md) includes technical implementaion details for the project. You will find the reasoning behind my technical decisions along its development, which shortcomings it still has, and how to make sense of its main components.
3. [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) discusses the features I consider the most importants for the future, and the reasoning behind these recommendations.
